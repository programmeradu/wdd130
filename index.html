        <p>Ghana is a country located along the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa. Known for its rich history, diverse wildlife, and warm hospitality, Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957. The capital city, Accra, is a vibrant metropolis that blends modern development with traditional culture. Ghana is famous for its beautiful beaches, national parks, and historical sites related to the transatlantic slave trade, such as the Cape Coast and Elmina Castles.</p>
